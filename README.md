# Robotic_Arm
This is my 4 DOF Robotic Arm project with current STL files of the 3D CAD model, an interactive Inverse and Forward Kinematics website to visualize movement, and the code to control the robotic arm (in progress).

Here is the link to the website if interested: https://2dof-kinematics-simulation.streamlit.app/
